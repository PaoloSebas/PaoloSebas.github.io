excerpt: "The study of non-hydrolytic reactions for the synthesis of Mg x Al2(1−x)Ti(1+x)O5 solid solution with x = 0.6 is reported. The reagents chosen were Al(OsBu)3, Ti(OiPr)4, TiCl4 and Mg(NO3)2·6H2O in toluene. The reactions were followed using 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Sol-gel synthesized powders were calcined in air at 300, 500, 1000, and 1200°C for 1 h. The powders were analysed by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) demonstrating the formation of a Mg0.6Al0.8Ti1.6O5 phase in samples treated at the higher calcination temperature."
