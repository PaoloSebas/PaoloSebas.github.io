title: "Photophysical oxidation of HCHO produces HO2 radicals"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2023-PPO
excerpt: "At photolysis energies below the energetic threshold for radical formation we directly detect HO2 at low pressures by cavity ring-down spectroscopy and indirectly detect HO2 at 1 bar by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy end-product analysis. Supported by electronic structure theory and master equation simulations, we attribute this HO2 to photophysical oxidation (PPO): photoexcited HCHO relaxes non-radiatively to the ground electronic state where the far-from-equilibrium, vibrationally activated HCHO molecules react with thermal O2. PPO is likely to be a general mechanism in tropospheric chemistry and, unlike photolysis, PPO will increase with increasing O2 pressure."
