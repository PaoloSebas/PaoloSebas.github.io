excerpt: "A systematic characterization of the frontier molecular orbitals (FMO) of gas‐phase prenucleation complexes between H2SO4 and other molecules present in the atmosphere (NH3, H2O, (CH3)OH, HF, (CH3)2PH, (CH3)SH) is carried out using the ωB97X‐D/6‐311++(2d,2p) method at the density functional theory level of theory."
