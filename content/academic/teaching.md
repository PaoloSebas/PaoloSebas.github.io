**Teaching Philosphy**

My teaching philosophy is fundamentally rooted in the conviction that education is a social practice with a central goal: to foster the growth of critical and socially responsible individuals. I teach because instruction is not a detached intellectual exercise; it is an act that recognizes that "we are part of a society."

For me, effective teaching is a form of adaptive, real-time practice. It is a bidirectional process where the instructor serves as an expert facilitator, not merely a content transmitter. Therefore, effective learning means the active construction and interpretation of concepts (Socio-Constructivism), enabling students to move beyond simple memorization and develop intellectual humility—acknowledging that neither they nor I know everything, but that knowledge can be powerfully built through collaboration.

My specific teaching style follows a model of Socio-Constructivist and Differentiated Pedagogy. I structure learning as a collaboration defined by shared accountability. I utilize dialogue, reflection, and comparison to guide students towards interpreting complex concepts.

What makes me unique as an educator is my commitment to pedagogical adaptability and psychological safety. My practice is grounded in the principle that everyone in the educational context (students, colleagues, and myself) are human beings with vulnerabilities, strengths, and a capacity for participation that varies daily. To address this variability and ensure inclusivity, I actively practice Reflective Teaching, monitoring non-verbal cues to immediately adjust my approach and delivery speed, thereby sustaining engagement and participation.

Regarding the classroom covenant, students can expect from me a learning environment built on equity, inclusion, and psychological safety. They can expect that I will not make distinctions based on background, culture, or orientation, and that I will support Differentiated Instruction, striving to identify the most efficient learning method for them as individuals. In return, I expect from students that they will be active, reflective partners in the educational journey—bringing intellectual curiosity and a willingness to engage in the collaborative process of knowledge construction.

Finally, I commit to continuous improvement through a constant cycle of critical reflective practice. This is most evident in how I manage classroom communication: I deliberately ask, "Did I explain myself clearly? Do you think I explained it well?" rather than "Do you understand?". This practice ensures I treat any confusion as potential feedback on my delivery, guiding my continuous pedagogical refinement.

**International Experience** 

I spent more than three years at the National University of La Pampa (UNLPam) as a Subject Coordinator, a Lecturer, and an Associate Lecturer in different subjects: General Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, Electromagnetism, General Physics, Mathemathics. It was a challenging and enriching time, in another country delivering concepts in another language ...
