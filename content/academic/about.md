I am an experienced educator specialising in General Chemisry, Physical Chemistry and Physics, with a proven track record of teaching across universities and secondary schools. My expertise spans diverse international and social contexts, including work in Italy, Argentina and Australia. I have taught students from ages 12 to adults. I have successfully progressed through roles from tutor and lab demonstrator to lecturer and subject coordinator.

My background in Chemistry and Physics allowed me to explore various domains of the modern science, leveraging interdisciplinary approaches to elucidate processes in Environment and Earth Science, Atmospheric Physics, Computational Chemistry, Combustion, and Materials Science.
