I spent more than three years at the National University of La Pampa ([UNLPam](https://www.unlpam.edu.ar/)) as a Subject Coordinator, a Lecturer, and an Associate Lecturer in different subjects: General Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, Electromagnetism, General Physics, Mathemathics. It was a challenging time, in another country delivering concepts in another language, but it was really beautiful.
